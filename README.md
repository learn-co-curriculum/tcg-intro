# Intro to Technical Coach Growth Curriculum

Welcome to Flatiron School! (or, if you were here before as a studnet, welcome back!)

As a Technical Coach, you'll be helping students make their way through the Flatiron program. In order to support their technical growth, you need technical growth too! This curriculum will guide your technical growth over the next few months as you get ramped up as a teacher and continue to grow as a developer.

## Curriculum Overview

```
- Build and Solidify Fundamentals
- Intermediate and highly leveraged skills
- Deeper Dives into adjacent topics
```

The curriculum will start by shoring up your fundamentals in Flatiron's core curriculum. In order to help students with ruby and javascript, you need to make sure you feel comfortable with those languages and the related tools. Next, we'll cover tools and skills that will be super useful as you learn more. We'll follow that up with deeper dives into advanced topics on curriculum-adjacent material. We won't cover everything, but we'll give you enough depth and loose threads that you'll have plenty more to keep unraveling.

## Topics

SQL
Ruby
Data Modeling
Rails
Javascript
React
Computing
Engineering and Dev Tools
Redux
Regular Expressions
Testing
Refactoring
Git
Debugging
Benchmarking
CSS

CS / Algorithms


## Schedule and Logistics


## Principles

1. Impactful
Do higher impact things sooner in the curriculum.
'Leveraged' content (learning testing, debugging, and benchmarking helps you learn other concepts)
Better content has more impact per time spent (e.g. Git Immersion is better than reading a Rails guide)
Doing the labs the students will see is good for building context as well as for learning the content. Do the labs!

2. Cyclical
Return to concepts, don't just do them once.
Use the techniques earlier in the curriculum to do things later in the curriculum. This gives us a chance to revisit them in a deeper way, and use them as tools for learning the advanced concepts

3. Fundamental
Start with the basics first, and always aim for understanding. Flatiron's curriculum is relevant and worthwhile. If you haven't gone through the curriculum, go through the core labs that are highlighted in the wiki. Get the core learning done before this content.
