# Intro to Technical Coach Growth Curriculum

Welcome to Flatiron School! (or, if you were here before as a student, welcome back!)

As a Technical Coach, you'll be helping students make their way through the Flatiron program. In order to support their technical growth, you need technical growth too! This curriculum will guide your technical growth over the next few months as you get ramped up as a teacher and continue to grow as a developer.

## Curriculum Overview

```
- Solidify Fundamentals
- Intermediate and highly leveraged skills
- Deeper Dives into adjacent topics
```

The curriculum will start by shoring up your fundamentals in Flatiron's core curriculum. In order to help students with ruby, Rails, javascript, and React, you need to make sure you feel comfortable with those languages, frameworks, and related tools. The fundamentals curriculum will move you quickly to a level of confidence in those concepts so that you feel prepared to teach them to students and help them debug issues they'll run into. Next, we'll cover tools and skills that will be super useful as you learn more. We'll follow that up with deeper dives into advanced topics on curriculum-adjacent material. We won't cover everything, but we'll give you enough depth and loose threads that you'll have plenty more to keep unraveling.

## Principles

1. **Impactful**

Do higher impact things sooner. Some content is better 'Leveraged' than others. For instance, testing, debugging, and benchmarking help you learn other concepts, while learning ActionCable only teaches you about ActionCable. 

Similarly, better content has more impact per time spent. Some lessons will teach you more, faster, because they are higher quality learning experiences. For example, _Git Immersion_ is better than reading a Rails guide. It's better to do the better content sooner.

2. **Cyclical**

Return to concepts, don't just do them once. Use the techniques earlier in the curriculum to do things later in the curriculum. This gives us a chance to revisit each concept in a deeper way, reinforce understanding, as well as use them as tools for learning more advanced concepts.

3. **Fundamental**

Start with the basics first, and always aim for understanding. Having the building blocks in place helps build confidence that you can approach any advanced concept with the relevant context. Building expertise also requires building deep knowledge of a few concepts, rather than shallow knowledge of many concepts. This curriculum focuses on fundamentals and extending knowledge 'near' the core curriculum instead of branching out to other languages, frameworks, or topics.

Flatiron's curriculum is relevant and worthwhile. That's why we teach it! The lessons are also relatively well-designed - if they aren't, it's a good chance to flag that content for improvement. Doing the labs the students will see is good for building context for the student experience as well as for learning the content. Do the labs, particularly if you haven't gone through the curriculum already. Even if you have, repeating a lab is usually quick and helpful practice.

## Logistics and Schedule

This curriculum will cover your first 17 weeks as a Software Engineering Coach. You'll spend about 5 hours per week working on this curriculum, for a total of about 80 hours in this curriculum. 

Depending on the week and the progress of your students on campus, the amount of time you spend on this material in any given week will vary. You should work with the instructional team on campus - your SPM and the other instructors in particular - to figure out where in the calendar you can find time for this, while still maintaining the student support. Depending on the staffing needs for each cohort, this may mean shifting your progress through this curriculum to students' project week, so that they have all the support they need as they make progress through the core curriculum.

> Note: Your priority as a TCF is first to your students success, then to your professional development. This curriculum will be super fun, but it doesn't supercede your work supporting students!

## FAQ

**What if I don't start with mod 1?**

This curriculum is written assuming that you'll start with a cohort as they start mod 1. Depending on staffing needs, this will not always be the case! If you are starting with a cohort in a different mod, you should modify the schedule so that you are covering the material that is relevant to what your students are learning. In short, if you are starting with a cohort that is learning javascript, you should do the javascript fundamentals before the ruby fundamentals, so that you are fresh on those concepts.

**What if I know this stuff already?**

You'll inevitably run into concepts that are already familiar. Usually, it's worthwhile material to review. If you find yourself bored, there are some strategies that might help. 

- Evaluate the material as a teacher. Is it an effective way to introduce the concept at hand? If there are ways to change the way we teach the material, we can always improve! Open an issue or a PR.
- Skip ahead to the self-check or assessment for the material. If you succeed on the assessment, that should be a strong indicator of your understanding. If the assessment reveals particular areas to review, focus your learning on those areas in particular
- Talk to your SPM or other instructors about your learning goals. This curriculum is intended as a tool to help you grow, but it won't fit every situation. We can adapt to your interests!


**What if I never learned ruby / rails / javascript?**

This curriculum assumes that your starting place is approximately at the level of a graduate of the Flatiron Immersive Software Engineering program. There is a lot of review of the foundational material and checks to ensure that that content knowledge is in place, but it is not a replacement for that curriculum. If you are learning ruby or javascript for the first time, you might need to spend more time outside of this curriculum. The lessons in the Flatiron SE curriculum are a good starting point.

**What if I run out of curriculum to follow?**

This curriculum is filled with loose threads and pointers to further reading. Read further! One big goal of this curriculum is to further develop your skills to learn independently. When you reach the end of this curriculum, you should have a strong habit in place of self-assessment, goal setting, finding learning resources, and teaching yourself a new skill. You should pause to review your goals, set new ones, and discuss them with your team. Never stop learning!

**What if I want to learn C# / Vue / MongoDB / etc and it isn't in this curriculum?**

There is always more to learn. It's super exciting that you want to learn those technologies and skills! We've focused this curriculum on content that is immediately relevant as a teacher and adjacent to the core Flatiron Software Engineering curriculum. We think you should focus on this stuff first, before moving on to technologies further from the core curriculum. 

However, if there are particular other skills you'd like to pursue in addition to this curriculum, you should discuss with your team about supporting that learning. Some situations in particular that would make sense to deviate from the curriculum, such as if you finish this curriculum or if there are other people on your team who have experience with a particular technology that you'd like to learn.

**Who should I turn to for help with this curriculum?**

Like we teach students, you should spend some time trying to work through tricky bugs or concepts before you reach out for help. At the same time, you shouldn't spend a long time stuck. Thankfully, you are part of the best and friendliest code learning community around, so you have lots of people to turn to for help! You can lean on other developers on your campus, 

**I found a bug / clarification / great resource, how can I fix it / clarify it / add it to this curriculum?**

This curriculum is alive (like all of our Flatiron curriculum)! If your bugfix or improvement fits with a particular lesson, create an issue or PR on that lesson (the learn-co-curriculum version, please!). If you have a larger question or idea for new labs, reordering lessons, or another change to the way the program works, your first best bet will be to reach out to @academics_support or the #teachers channel on slack to start the discussion. We can't make every change instantly, but we expect to make tons of changes over time!
