# Intro to Technical Coach Growth Curriculum

Welcome to Flatiron School! (or, if you were here before as a student, welcome back!)

As a Technical Coach, you'll be helping students make their way through the Flatiron program. In order to support their technical growth, you need technical growth too! This curriculum will guide your technical growth over the next few months as you get ramped up as a teacher and continue to grow as a developer.

## Curriculum Overview

```
- Solidify Fundamentals
- Intermediate and highly leveraged skills
- Deeper Dives into adjacent topics
```

The curriculum will start by shoring up your fundamentals in Flatiron's core curriculum. In order to help students with ruby, Rails, javascript, and React, you need to make sure you feel comfortable with those languages, frameworks, and related tools. The fundamentals curriculum will move you quickly to a level of confidence in those concepts so that you feel prepared to teach them to students and help them debug issues they'll run into. Next, we'll cover tools and skills that will be super useful as you learn more. We'll follow that up with deeper dives into advanced topics on curriculum-adjacent material. We won't cover everything, but we'll give you enough depth and loose threads that you'll have plenty more to keep unraveling.

## Principles

1. **Impactful**

Do higher impact things sooner. Some content is better 'Leveraged' than others. For instance, testing, debugging, and benchmarking help you learn other concepts, while learning ActionCable only teaches you about ActionCable. 

Similarly, better content has more impact per time spent. Some lessons will teach you more, faster, because they are higher quality learning experiences. For example, _Git Immersion_ is better than reading a Rails guide. It's better to do the better content sooner.

2. **Cyclical**

Return to concepts, don't just do them once. Use the techniques earlier in the curriculum to do things later in the curriculum. This gives us a chance to revisit each concept in a deeper way, reinforce understanding, as well as use them as tools for learning more advanced concepts.

3. **Fundamental**

Start with the basics first, and always aim for understanding. Having the building blocks in place helps build confidence that you can approach any advanced concept with the relevant context. Building expertise also requires building deep knowledge of a few concepts, rather than shallow knowledge of many concepts. This curriculum focuses on fundamentals and extending knowledge 'near' the core curriculum instead of branching out to other languages, frameworks, or topics.

Flatiron's curriculum is relevant and worthwhile. That's why we teach it! The lessons are also relatively well-designed - if they aren't, it's a good chance to flag that content for improvement. Doing the labs the students will see is good for building context for the student experience as well as for learning the content. Do the labs, particularly if you haven't gone through the curriculum already. Even if you have, repeating a lab is usually quick and helpful practice.
